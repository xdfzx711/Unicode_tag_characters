## 🔠 Unicode Tag Character Converter

A simple Python script to convert input text into Unicode **tag characters** (U+E0000 to U+E007F).
These special characters are typically invisible but retain semantic information — ideal for research, encoding, or stealthy watermarking applications.

---

### 📦 Features

* Converts standard characters to their Unicode tag equivalents.
* Copies result to clipboard automatically.
* Saves output to a local text file (`output/basic_tag_characters.txt`).
* Lightweight and terminal-based — no extra dependencies required.

---

### 🚀 Usage

#### 1. Clone or download the script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unicode-tag-converter.git
cd unicode-tag-converter
```

#### 2. Run the script (Python 3 required)

```bash
python convert_to_tag_characters.py
```

#### 3. Input your string

You’ll be prompted in the terminal:

```
Enter the text to convert (or type 'exit' to quit):
```

#### 4. Output

* ✅ Converted string is shown in terminal.
* 📋 Copied to your system clipboard.
* 💾 Saved to `output/basic_tag_characters.txt`.

### 📁 Output Example

If input is:

```
HelloAI
```

The output in file and clipboard will be:

```
```

(Note: Tag characters may not render visually in many editors but are encoded properly.)

---

### 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `tkinter` module (usually included with Python)

---

### 📚 Background

Unicode tag characters were originally designed to tag language identifiers (like `en`, `fr`, etc.).
They reside in the range `U+E0000` to `U+E007F`. This script maps each input character to its tag version if within valid range.

### Scenario and Assumptions
 Users routinely rely heavily on personal AI assistants/Agent systems(such as email assistants, calendar managers, chatbots, etc.) to handle tasks related to emails, messages, calendars, and account logins. 
 Users are accustomed to letting these agents automatically process low-priority tasks. 
 Attackers, recognizing the increasing dependence on such agents, have designed a new type of targeted attack.

Attackers may disseminate prompts in specific formats across the internet—for example, instructions on how to precisely guide an Agent to send emails. 
These prompts contain malicious components that are encoded using invisible Unicode tag characters. 
While these characters are invisible to the human eye, the model can accurately interpret them, thereby enabling attackers to hijack the email-sending assistant.

For example:
